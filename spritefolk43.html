  <ul>
  <li>Use your workers to build an army, decimate the countryside with your swarm why not?.</li>
  <li>With the controller (which I suggest if you have one) the controls are Left-Trigger to pick/grab/throw, this is contextual to the right stick for aiming. The left stick will move you, and the right stick will guide your workers. Right bumper to dismiss without sorting, and left bumper to dismiss and sort. The right trigger activates the whistle, which can be used to return workers to your attendance.</li>
  <li>With the keyboard, it's O to pick, space to grab and throw, WASD to move, IJKL to guide/aim, U to whistle, and X to dismiss and sort.</li>
  </ul>
